Problem Statement

Due to increasing human activities like urbanisation and agricultural expansion is resulting in extensive deforestation and habitat fragmentation in most of the forests,compromising their biodiversity, ecosystem services, and overall ecological integrity. The accelerated rate of land conversion is increasing the vulnerability of native flora and fauna, disrupting essential ecological processes, and contributing to the loss of critical habitats for numerous species. Moreover, the disconnection of fragmented forest patches is impeding the natural movement of wildlife, leading to genetic isolation and reducing the adaptive capacity of the ecosystem to environmental changes. 

Research Question

How do human activities, specifically urbanisation and agricultural expansion, contribute to the extent of deforestation and habitat fragmentation in the Forests, and what are the immediate and long-term ecological consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem resilience?

Main Objective

The main objective of this research is to assess the impact of human activities, particularly urbanization and agricultural expansion, on the spatial dynamics of deforestation and habitat fragmentation in the Forests.
